# Heart_Failure_Prediction
The objective of this project is to forecast the risk factors causing Heart failure using using Multiple Algorithms such as:

 - Logistic Regression
    
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    
- Decision Trees
    
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Voting Ensemble

**Dataset:**
    
918 records with 12 features (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and heart disease status).

**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Ages Distribution related to Heart Disieases**

**Key Findings:**

The Voting Ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy (87.83%) and precision (91.27%).
The Voting Ensemble combined the strengths of individual models for more reliable predictions. The objective of this project is to forecast the risk factors causing Heart failure.</p>
